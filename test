# this is a grammar with a similar
# line structure to python

if something:
  then we indent
else:
    something else
    # note a different indent size here

def function(a, b, c):
  we can nest blocks:
    like this
  and we can also \
    have explicit continuations \
    with \
any \
       indentation

same for (argument,
                    lists):
  which do not need the
  continuation marker
  # and we can have blank lines inside a block:

  like this
    # along with strangely placed comments
  but still keep blocks tied together
